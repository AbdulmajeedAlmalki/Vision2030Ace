        <h1>What is the Qiddiya?</h1>
        <h2>Launch </h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Qiddiya Launched in 2018 by King Salman bin Abdulaziz, Qiddiya City is a global entertainment,
            sports, and culture hub in the making. It is the first development from Qiddiya, the organization behind the
            power of play, and will be an epicenter of entertainment, sports and culture, welcoming Saudi nationals,
            residents, and tourists alike. It will offer international sports arenas, concert and entertainment venues,
            academies for sports and the arts, racetracks, outdoor and adventure activities and family-friendly theme
            parks – including a Six Flags theme park and a water theme park, both offering rides and experiences never
            seen before.
        </p>
        <h2>BUSINESS</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;City is key to building KSA into a thriving economy, and an ambitious nation. Qiddiya seeks to
            build destinations, programs and initiatives with play at its core, that will enhance the quality of life of
            visitors and residents. With 67% of Saudis under 35, Qiddiya City will provide the Kingdom’s youthful
            population with new opportunities for entertainment, employment, and fun. By offering a world-class tourism
            destination in the heart of Saudi Arabia, the project will create new jobs, help build a more prosperous and
            vibrant society, and give Saudis the opportunity to spend their holidays and spare time enjoying world class
            entertainment without the need to travel abroad.
